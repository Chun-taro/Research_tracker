# Comparison Report: Research Tracker vs. Project Requirements

This report compares your current **Research Tracker** implementation against the specific requirements for the **Multi-Tenant SaaS Web Application** final project.

## Summary Table

| Requirement | Status | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Multi-Tenancy Architecture** | ✅ **Full Match** | Uses `spatie/laravel-multitenancy` with a **One App – Multi Database** architecture. Isolated storage is physically enforced. |
| **2. Tenant Customization** | ✅ **Full Match** | Supports **Branding** (colors, names) and **Tiers** (feature-set variations). |
| **3. Tenant Identification** | ✅ **Full Match** | Supports both **Domain-based** (`sub.domain.com`) and **Slug-based** (`slug.localhost`) identification. |
| **4. RBAC** | ✅ **Full Match** | Implements custom roles: `Student`, `Adviser`, `Panelist`, and `Admin` with per-tenant isolation. |
| **5. Pricing Model** | ✅ **Full Match** | Includes `Basic`, `Standard`, and `Premium` tiers with enforced restrictions (e.g., group limits). |
| **6. Automatic Updates** | ✅ **Full Match** | Being a "One App" system, code updates in the central repository propagate to all tenants simultaneously. |
| **7. Security Implementation** | ✅ **Full Match** | Built on Laravel’s robust security stack (Auth, CSRF, SQL Injection protection). |
| **8. Data Encapsulation** | ✅ **Full Match** | Multi-database architecture provides the highest level of physical data separation. |

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Architecture & Isolation
- **Compliance**: The system uses the **One-Application, Multi-Database** concept as requested.
- **Technical Detail**: The `landlord` connection handles central management, while the `tenant` connection dynamically switches databases based on the active department.

### 2. Customization & Branding
- **Branding**: Tenants have their own `name`, `slug`, and `theme_color` (which I recently emphasized in the UI).
- **Features**: Features are restricted based on the `subscription_tier`. For example, the `Basic` plan is limited to 5 research groups, while `Premium` is unlimited.

### 3. Pricing & Subscription
- **Tiers**: `Basic`, `Standard`, and `Premium` are fully implemented in the database and UI.
- **Workflow**: The system tracks `subscription_expires_at` and prevents access if the plan is expired.

### 4. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- The system doesn't just have generic users; it has specific roles for the research process (`Adviser`, `Panelist`, `Student`), and permissions are scoped to the tenant database.

### 5. Automatic Updates
- Since you are using a centralized codebase with different databases, any change pushed to the `main` branch (like our recent UI updates) is immediately available to all tenants once deployed. Database schema updates are managed through centralized `tenants:migrate` commands.
